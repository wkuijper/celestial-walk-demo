Celestial Walk Demo
===================

This repository contains code implementing the celestial walk, as well as the visibility walk 
and the straight walk for point location in two-dimensional meshes.

The implementation is self contained. Do note that the mesh is not reusable as is. In particular 
it can only handle small, integer coordinates robustly.
